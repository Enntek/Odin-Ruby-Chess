En passant after pawn capture
Castling, king moves 2 or 3 spaces, rook moves a bunch.

Way later:
castle, both types, check if unmoved
check: put opponent in check, do not put self in check
checkmate
tie (use move list)

if opp piece is diagonal from pawn, allow diag movement
if diag square is empty, do not allow diag movement
if opp piece is blocking 1 or 2 step forward movement, path is obstructed
Eventually: En Passant

Add conditionals to path obstructed for straight moves + opponent blocking
Add conditionals to reachable? or path_obstructed? for diagonal capture moves with no opponent, prevent it
