For pawn_capture, we may or may not turn that into a variant.
The base move would be the same, however end_sq would be an opponent's piece.
It could work, it would have very little code though.

How do we calculate base_move without instantiating?
Condition for castle: difference in x axis is 2
Condition for en passant: if y axis differs
We can also use a module.

Implement #inherited later
To do so: remove self-registering code from each variant
Then add a method #inherited, send #register message in body.

Fix castle for black. 
Then work on MoveType, a factory


tie (use move list)
